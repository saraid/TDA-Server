TODO:
Special flights
Triggered Powers

Stuff that's done:
1. Entering the game. (Fail: No way to start the game arbitrarily.)
2. Moving gold between players and the pot.
3. Initializing and drawing from the deck.
4. Playing an entire gambit.
4a. Choosing ante cards. (Fail: Tied antes don't happen; it just bypasses.)
4b. Playing through rounds, including choosing leader, altering turn order, power activation, and changing leader based on previous round.
4c. Handling the end of gambit is pretty decent. (Fail: Gambit is supposed to end immediately when pot is empty, but instead it's played through. Need to check for that and throw an exception after card plays to climb the stack.)

I also need to add chat capability (meh) and status reports in response to queries (how much is in the pot? how strong is his flight? how many cards in his hand? how much in his hoard? etc.). OTOH, a lot of this would be dealt with better via a graphical client.
